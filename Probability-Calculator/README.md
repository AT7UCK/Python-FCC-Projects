# Probability Calculator

## Description
Built a Probability Calculator to simulate random draws from a hat and calculate expected outcomes. Focused on simulations, copying objects, and statistical reasoning.

## Features
- Simulates random draws from a hat
- Calculates probability of specific outcomes
- Runs multiple experiments to estimate probability

## Skills Learned
- Python Classes & OOP
- Random Module & Simulation
- Dictionary Manipulation
- Statistical Thinking
- Problem Solving

## Usage
Run the `probability_calculator.py` file, create a Hat object, and call `experiment()` function with expected balls and number of draws.
