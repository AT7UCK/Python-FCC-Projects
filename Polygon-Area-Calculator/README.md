# Polygon Area Calculator

## Description
Implemented a Polygon Area Calculator in Python to compute areas and perimeters of rectangles and squares. Practiced OOP, methods, and reusable code.

## Features
- Calculate area, perimeter, and diagonal
- Generate a text-based picture of shapes
- Compute how many times a shape fits inside another

## Skills Learned
- Python Classes & OOP
- Math Module & Calculations
- Method Design & Reusability
- Problem Solving
- Code Structuring

## Usage
Run the `polygon_area_calculator.py` file, create Rectangle or Square objects, and call methods like `get_area()` and `get_picture()`.
